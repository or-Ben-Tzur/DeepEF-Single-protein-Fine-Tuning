DeepEF Extension: Fine-Tuning for Specific Proteins
Overview
This project is an extension of the original DeepEF model developed by Shaharec. While DeepEF is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed to estimate protein free energy based on thermodynamic principles, our work aims to fine-tune the model to improve its performance on specific proteins.

Relationship to the Original DeepEF
The original DeepEF framework constructs a physics-inspired, data-driven model for free energy estimation, relying on synthetic data and thermodynamic principles. Our extension builds upon this foundation.
